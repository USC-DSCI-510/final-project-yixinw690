# DSCI 510 Final Project
Discover the Restaurant Diversity in Boston

## Team Members 
Yixin Wang & Yiqian Zheng

## Instructions to create a conda enviornment
For macOS and Linux, you can just open the regular terminal.
```
conda create -n income_cuisine_analysis python=3.8
```
This command creates a new conda environment named income_cuisine_analysis with Python 3.8 installed. You can replace 3.8 with any version of Python that you need for your project.
## Instructions on how to install the required libraries
The libraries used in our project include requests, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. Install the libraries by running following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Instructions on how to download the data
Run the code in get_data.py to download the restaurant data and income data from Yelp API and Census Bureau API. API keys are included in the code. 2 csv files named " restaurants_in_boston.csv" and " census_income_data_acs_boston.csv" will be downloaded.
## Instructions on how to clean the data
Run the code in clean_data.py to conduct data cleaning. 
* For the restaurants data, 3 csv files will be downloaded in 3 steps.
  - Firstly, remove restaurants without cuisine tags.
  - Secondly, relabel the restaurants' cuisine types. (e.g. American includes New American, American, Hawaiian, and Southern) 
  - Lastly, remove the restaurants that are not in the Boston Metropolitan zip codes, and remove the original cuisine labels column as well.
* So the final restaurants data csv used for analysis is called "filtered_restaurants_without_cuisine_types.csv".
* For the income data, we summarized the original 10 brackets into 6 bracktes, and created the new table called "census_income_data_acs_boston_cleaned_combined_reordered.csv" 
## Instrucions on how to run analysis code
Run the code in run_analysis.py to get all the visualization and descriptive analysis of the data.
## Instructions on how to create visualizations
Run the code in visualize_results.py to get graphs of our analysis. The only difference between the analysis code and visualization code is the analysis code generate some descriptive statistics results of our analysis.
